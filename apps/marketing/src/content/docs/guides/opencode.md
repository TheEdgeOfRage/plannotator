Plannotator integrates with OpenCode as an npm plugin. By default it makes `submit_plan` available to OpenCode's `plan` agent only, so OpenCode plan mode can use Plannotator without exposing the tool to `build`.

If you are upgrading from an older OpenCode setup, read the [0.19.1 migration guide](/docs/guides/opencode-migration-0-19-1/) first.

## How the plugin works

The OpenCode plugin (`@plannotator/opencode`) hooks into OpenCode's plugin system:

1. The plugin registers a `submit_plan` tool for OpenCode's built-in `plan` agent and any extra planning agents you configure
2. When `submit_plan` is called, Plannotator starts a local server and opens the browser
3. The user reviews and annotates the plan
4. On approval, the plugin returns a success response to the agent
5. On denial, the plugin returns feedback with the current plan state, and the agent applies targeted edits

## Workflow modes

OpenCode support has four explicit modes:

- **`plan-agent`** (default): `submit_plan` is available to OpenCode's built-in `plan` agent plus any extra agents listed in `planningAgents`.
- **`manual`**: `submit_plan` is not registered. Use `/plannotator-last`, `/plannotator-annotate`, and `/plannotator-review` when you want Plannotator. On OpenCode 2 the agent can still open a review with the [`plannotator` tool](#the-plannotator-tool), which every mode registers.
- **`user-managed`**: `submit_plan` is registered but no prompts or agent permissions are modified. You configure which agents can call `submit_plan` via OpenCode's agent configuration.
- **`all-agents`**: legacy broad behavior. Primary agents can see and call `submit_plan`.

Default config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["plan"]
    }]
  ]
}
```

If you use other OpenCode plugins, keep everything in the same `plugin` array and attach Plannotator's options directly to the Plannotator entry:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["plan", "sisyphus"]
    }],
    "@tarquinen/opencode-dcp@latest",
    "octto",
    "oh-my-opencode-slim"
  ]
}
```

Do not put `{ "workflow": "plan-agent" }` as its own item in the `plugin` array. OpenCode plugin entries must be either a plugin string or a two-item array like `[pluginName, options]`.

If you want the old broad behavior:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "all-agents"
    }]
  ]
}
```

If you want commands only:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "manual"
    }]
  ]
}
```

If you want the tool registered but want to manage prompts and permissions yourself:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "user-managed"
    }]
  ]
}
```

## Custom planning agents

OpenCode's built-in `plan` agent is always included in `plan-agent` mode. If you use another planning agent, add its OpenCode agent name to `planningAgents`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["planner", "sisyphus"]
    }]
  ]
}
```

With other plugins, the same rule applies. Only the Plannotator entry becomes a tuple with options:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    ["@plannotator/opencode@latest", {
      "workflow": "plan-agent",
      "planningAgents": ["planner", "sisyphus"]
    }],
    "oh-my-opencode-slim",
    "openviking-opencode"
  ]
}
```

## Approve with annotations

Unlike Claude Code, OpenCode supports feedback on approval. This means:

- **Approve** (no annotations) — Agent proceeds with implementation
- **Approve** (with annotations) — Agent proceeds, but also receives your annotations as notes
- **Send Feedback** — Plan is rejected. Agent receives your annotations and revises the plan.

This makes it possible to approve a plan while leaving minor suggestions that the agent can incorporate during implementation.

## Agent switching

OpenCode supports multiple agents. By default, approved plans are handed off to the build agent, while code review feedback stays on your current agent. To change either, configure [Agent switching settings](/docs/getting-started/ui-settings/#agent-switching):

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Under "Agent Switch", select from available agents or enter a custom agent name
3. On approval, the selected agent receives the plan (if Agent Switch is disabled, your current agent continues)

If the configured agent isn't found in the current OpenCode session, Plannotator logs a warning and shows a warning toast, then sends approval or feedback without switching agents.

## Slash commands

The plugin registers slash commands that work in every workflow mode:

### `/plannotator-review`

Opens a code review UI for uncommitted changes. Also supports reviewing GitHub pull requests:

```
/plannotator-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

The session-only open-state flags work here too — `/plannotator-review --base feature/part-1` opens against a specific base (git-only; nothing is persisted).

Requires the CLI to be installed (the slash command runs `plannotator review` under the hood).

### `/plannotator-annotate <file.md>`

Opens a markdown file, directory, or URL in the annotation UI. Also requires the CLI.

### `/plannotator-last`

Annotates the agent's most recent message. See the [annotate last docs](/docs/commands/annotate-last/) for details.

Install the CLI for slash command support:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://plannotator.ai/install.sh | bash
```

This also clears cached plugin versions for both OpenCode 1 and OpenCode 2. To update the plugin later, run the install script again and restart OpenCode.

## The `plannotator` tool

On OpenCode 2 the plugin also gives the agent a `plannotator` tool, in every workflow mode. Ask the agent to "open notes.md in Plannotator" or "let me review these changes in Plannotator", and it opens the review itself:

- The tool returns as soon as the page is open, so the session does not wait while you review.
- The agent can pass several files to open them as one review, in the order it chose.
- Your feedback arrives later as a new message. Its first line names what you reviewed and the review's session id, for example `Plannotator: notes.md (pn-3f2a9c) — Feedback.`
- The agent can list the reviews it opened in this session, including the ones you opened with the slash commands, and close one it no longer needs. Closing sends the agent nothing, and your unsent comments stay saved as a draft.
- A subagent can open a file or code review too. Its feedback arrives in your main session, which also lists and closes it.

Plan review still goes through `submit_plan`. The tool needs the CLI, like the slash commands. OpenCode 1 does not get the tool.

## Ask this session

On OpenCode 2, Ask AI in code review, annotate and `/plannotator-last` is answered by your OpenCode session ("Ask this session"), and it is the only Ask AI option there. In plan review the session is waiting for your decision, so it gives a quick answer from its context only. OpenCode 1 and remote sessions use a separate provider you pick. See [Ask this session](/docs/guides/ai-features/#ask-this-session).

## Plugin installation

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["@plannotator/opencode@latest"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode. With the default workflow, `submit_plan` is available to the `plan` agent. If you need `build` or another primary agent to call it, set `workflow` to `all-agents`. See the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation/) for full details.

## Devcontainer / Docker

OpenCode in a container works with the same remote mode environment variables:

```json
{
  "containerEnv": {
    "PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE": "1",
    "PLANNOTATOR_PORT": "9999"
  },
  "forwardPorts": [9999]
}
```

Open `http://localhost:9999` when `submit_plan` is called. See the [remote guide](/docs/guides/remote-and-devcontainers/) for more details.
