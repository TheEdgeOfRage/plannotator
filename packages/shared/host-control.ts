/**
 * Host-only session control: `GET /api/host/status` and `POST /api/host/close`.
 *
 * The agent session that launched a review (the Claude Code mod today; Pi and
 * OpenCode 2 through the same functions in-process) can ask what the review
 * holds and close it when it no longer needs it. Closing is the reviewer's
 * Close (decision `dismissed`, nothing sent to the agent) except that it is
 * marked `closedBy: "agent"` and the annotation draft is KEPT (it is not
 * deleted; whether a later session restores it follows that surface's own
 * draft key: annotate by document content, code review by patch or PR).
 *
 * Guarded exactly like the pull bridge (packages/ai/session-bridge-pull.ts):
 * a loopback Host header naming this server's port (DNS-rebinding guard), no
 * `Origin` header (a browser page is never the host), and
 * `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, the per-launch secret the host started the
 * server with (`PLANNOTATOR_SESSION_BRIDGE_TOKEN`). Without a token the paths
 * answer 404 with `code: "host_control_disabled"`, which a host reads as
 * "turned off" (an uncoded 404 is "an older Plannotator"). Available wherever
 * the host launched the server with that token, including under
 * `PLANNOTATOR_AI=disabled` (which turns the pull bridge itself off); never in
 * remote mode or a `--tailscale` session (which discards the token).
 *
 * Privacy: status carries counts, never comment text.
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic (vendored to Pi): plain data in and out; each server turns
 * the answer into its own response type.
